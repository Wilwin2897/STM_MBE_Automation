"# STM_MBE_Automation" 
This is an application program that will provide users with a 
semi-automated platform for controlling the temperature of the substrate heating 
and effusion cells based on several important factors such as the pressure of the 
MBE chamber, together with an automated mechanism for opening and closing 
the cell's shutters. In this way, human errors could be minimized and the user is 
able to obtain all parameters in real-time which are essential for quality control.

Modular control is finished EXCEPT for: Beam Flux Monitor and Filament current source
