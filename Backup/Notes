Tried to calculate Slab 2,4,6,8 layer for FeSn
CHANGES
    ecutrho                   =  4.23668e+02
    ecutwfc                   =  4.70743e+01
TO
    ecutrho                   =  176.39712 (8 times Ecut)
    ecutwfc                   =  22.04964 (300 eV)
Why use QE => FPLO NO RELAXATION MODULE, CANNOT CHECK THE STABILITY AND WHETHER THERE ARE SURFACE RECONSTRUCTIONS
Do the ideal lattice using FPLO to check for Slab 2,4,6,8 layer for FeSn
